    <p>We like to think in terms of cause and effect. Causal statements leave us with a sense of knowledge and control: they allow us to answer “what if” questions, and promise us leverage over reality—if you want to kill the effect, kill the cause.</p><p>But many <strong>real-world systems are poorly modeled by causality</strong>. Domains like economics, sociology, psychology, and ecology are full of feedback loops, where effects turn back on their causes. And when we try to impose causal explanations on these systems, we end up confused.</p><p>Let’s look at a few examples, and see how we can do better.</p><h2 id="outline">Outline</h2><ul><li><p><a href="#a-motivating-example">A Motivating Example</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#causal-diagrams">Causal Diagrams</a></p><ul><li><p><a href="#directed-acyclic-graphs">Directed Acyclic Graphs</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#causal-loop-diagrams">Causal Loop Diagrams</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="#causal-projection">Causal Projection</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#scoring-causal-explanations">Scoring Causal Explanations</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#stay-skeptical">Stay Skeptical</a></p></li></ul><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://superbowl.substack.com/subscribe"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h1 id="a-motivating-example">A Motivating Example</h1><p>Scott Alexander recently <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-first-sixth-of-bobos">reviewed</a> <em>Bobos In Paradise</em>, in which David Brooks makes a fantastical causal claim:</p><blockquote><p>The daring thesis: a 1950s change in Harvard admissions policy destroyed one American aristocracy and created another. Everything else is downstream of the aristocracy, so this changed the whole character of the US.</p></blockquote><p>Brooks cites a bunch of statistics about rising crime rates and children born out of wedlock in the decades that followed. Scott finds the argument compelling:</p><blockquote><p>These are the same data purportedly explained by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93crime_hypothesis">the lead-crime hypothesis</a>, where leaded gasoline poisoned young people’s brains and made them more impulsive. Last I checked this hypothesis had survived the replication crisis pretty well and continued to seem plausible. But Brooks’ theory is among the best alternatives I’ve heard.</p></blockquote><p>Scott even lists a bunch of other effects that may have spilled out of Harvard’s admissions change, including new architectural styles, culture wars, and political polarization. (To be fair, he acknowledges that all this is speculative—he’s just taking Brooks’ idea and running with it.)</p><p>But here’s a competing hypothesis: a lot of crazy shit happened in the US during the 50s and 60s. Some examples:</p><p>The civil rights movement. Hippies. Modern transistors. The assassinations of JFK, RFK, and MLK.  Free love. LSD.  The share households with a television goes from 9% to 95%. The Vietnam War. The rise of Silicon Valley. The first live TV broadcast. And yes, an Ivy League school changed its admissions policy.</p><p>None of these things strictly caused the others. LSD fueled the hippies; hippies in turn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_Tests">spread</a> LSD around the country. Vietnam protests energized the hippie movement, which then created a culture clash and cemented mainstream <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/18097/iraq-versus-vietnam-comparison-public-opinion.aspx">support</a> for the war. TV broadcasts built opposition to the war, but also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25FjB-2GUWY">fear</a> about LSD. MLK led the Civil Rights Movement; the publicity got him assassinated; the resulting riots <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_assassination_riots#Impact">forced</a> congress to pass the Civil Rights Act. And shortly after Harvard changed its admissions policy, Timothy Leary began <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Psilocybin_Project#Controversy">feeding</a> the new undergraduates psychedelics.</p><p>All these things contributed in their own ways to the massive sociocultural shift that took place in the second half of the 20th Century.</p><p>If you ask me what the “main cause” was, I’ll say LSD. But that’s because I <a href="/p/dreaming-is-better-than-meditation">write</a> <a href="/p/brothers-at-war-science-and-religion">about</a> psychedelics a lot. If you ask a war buff, they’ll tell you it was Vietnam. If you ask an expert on Black History, they’ll tell you the civil rights movement changed everything.</p><p>And all of us are right! We can each back up our claims with a convincing set of syllogisms. But each explanation appeals to a common fallacy: they impose causal explanations on a system as dynamic and chaotic as sociology.</p><h1 id="causal-diagrams">Causal Diagrams</h1><p>Causality is easy to visualize: all we need are circles and arrows.

We just discard or ignore facts that seem irrelevant. <strong>The discarded facts don’t necessarily run counter to our argument</strong>—they just connect secondary nodes. They might seem totally safe to discard.</p><p>For example, Brooks ignores the fact that the wider culture war—fueled by Vietnam and the hippie movement—potentiated the arrival of a new aristocracy. Or that a pre-existing shift in values might have influenced Harvard’s adoption of a meritocratic policy. Neither of these possibilities contradicts his thesis! But they lead to feedback loops that ultimately undermine it.</p><p>(Note: I haven’t actually read Brooks’ book, only Scott’s review—it’s possible he’s much more cautious about his claims. I’m just picking on him to make a point.)</p><h1 id="scoring-causal-explanations">Scoring Causal Explanations</h1><p>Despite the fact that causal explanations hide complex realities, some causal explanations are clearly better than others.

We haven’t done much damage to our picture of the world by removing them.</p><p>In general, <strong>we can give a score to any causal projection</strong> by summing up all the arrows that have been removed to support it. The fewer arrows you remove, and the smaller those arrows are, the better your argument holds up.</p><p>So every causal projection is a partial truth. The only question is how partial, and whether its explanatory power justifies the facts we had to sacrifice in the process.</p><h1 id="stay-skeptical">Stay Skeptical</h1><p>Once you seeing the world in terms of causal loops, it’s hard to unsee. Many of the biggest debates start to seem inane, with both sides cheering on their preferred etiology.</p><p>Some examples:</p><ul><li><p>Did a supply shock cause current levels of inflation?</p></li><li><p>Did the FBI’s investigation of Hillary Clinton cause Trump to win?</p></li><li><p>Does social media cause depression?</p></li><li><p>Did the assassination of an archduke cause WWI?</p></li><li><p>Do lockdowns cause COVID to stop spreading?</p></li><li><p>Did SBF’s stimulant addiction cause FTX’s downfall?</p></li><li><p>Did BLM protests cause an increase in murders?</p></li><li><p>Do neurochemical issues cause anxiety?</p></li></ul><p>In each debate, you’ll find domain experts saying, “well, actually, it’s kind of complicated…” only to be beaten down by partisans wielding causal projections like battle axes.</p><p>Both sides will make syllogistic arguments: A led to B, which led to C, and so on to Z, and every inference in the chain will seem sound. Some of these arguments hold up better than others, but in each case, there’s a complex web of feedback loops being ignored.</p><p><strong>The key is to look for the gaps</strong>: what facts have been omitted? The omissions don’t need to contradict the thesis—they only need to be big and relevant. Even many tiny omissions can hide a feedback loop that undermines the argument.</p><p>We need to treat causal explanations with skepticism. They <em>always</em> hide the truth—all we can do is try to figure out how much.</p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://superbowl.substack.com/subscribe"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>
