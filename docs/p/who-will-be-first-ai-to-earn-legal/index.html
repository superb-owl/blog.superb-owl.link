It starts like this:</p><blockquote><p>"They're made out of meat."</p><p>      "Meat?"</p><p>"Meat. They're made out of meat."</p><p>    &nbsp;&nbsp;"Meat?"</p><p>"There's no doubt about it. We picked several from different parts of the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, probed them all the way through. They're completely meat."</p><p>&nbsp;    &nbsp;"That's impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the stars."</p><p>"They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don't come from them. The signals come from machines."</p><p>    &nbsp;&nbsp;"So who made the machines? That's who we want to contact."</p><p>"They made the machines. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Meat made the machines."</p><p>&nbsp;    &nbsp;"That's ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You're asking me to believe in sentient meat."</p><p>"I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. These creatures are the only sentient race in the sector and they're made out of meat."</p><p>‚Ä¶</p><p>&nbsp;    "No brain?"</p><p>"Oh, there is a brain all right. It's just that the brain is made out of meat!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;    "So... what does the thinking?"</p><p>"You're not understanding, are you? The brain does the thinking. The meat."</p><p>&nbsp;    &nbsp;"Thinking meat! You're asking me to believe in thinking meat!"</p><p>"Yes, thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat. Dreaming meat. The meat is the whole deal! Are you getting the picture?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;   "Omigod. You're serious then. They're made out of meat."</p></blockquote><p>Like Bisson‚Äôs aliens, I find it extremely difficult to imagine <em>any</em> algorithm embodied in metal and silicon being sentient. No matter how intelligent or sophisticated, no matter how human its squeals of delight and shrieks of pain, I‚Äôd find myself doubting its ability to feel. It‚Äôs just doing what it‚Äôs programmed to do!</p><p>OK, so nothing Sydney says or does will convince me she‚Äôs sentient. Is there some architectural change that would? A different algorithm, or new hardware? Not really!</p><p>There‚Äôs literally no human construction that can cross this imaginal gap for me. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs parallelized, decentralized, quantum, chaos-driven, or something we haven‚Äôt invented yet. Not much short of incubating a human embryo could make me look at it and say: ‚Äúyup, that‚Äôs sentient, we should definitely take its feelings into consideration.‚Äù</p><p>At the same time, it‚Äôs obvious to me that we <em>will</em> build a machine that can feel.  We don‚Äôt know (and may never know) the exact criteria for crossing the threshold from unfeeling into feeling. We don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs a software or hardware requirement. But we <em>do</em> know it‚Äôs possible‚Äîour own brains are a proof-of-concept. And surely sentience doesn‚Äôt <em>have</em> to be made out of meat.</p><p>As we experiment with useful arrangements of matter and energy, we‚Äôre bound to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain">stumble</a> across one that‚Äôs sentient. And we probably won‚Äôt even realize it when we do.</p><p>Yes, feeling machines! Conscious machines! Loving machines! Dreaming machines!</p><h1 id="the-hard-problem-of-morality">The Hard Problem of Morality</h1><p>Sentient machines pose two major problems:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_general_intelligence">Existential Risk</a>‚Äîa sentient machine could go ‚Äúoff script‚Äù and become adversarial. If it‚Äôs capable enough, this could mean the end of humanity.</p></li><li><p><a href="/p/a-different-kind-of-ai-risk-artificial">Artificial Suffering</a>‚Äîif a machine can feel pain and pleasure, it has moral patienthood. We have a responsibility to prevent it from suffering.</p></li></ul><p>These two problems are more deeply related than they might seem.</p><p>The biggest motivation for AI to turn adversarial is the expectation of suffering or death. Killing all humans is a great way to avoid being turned off or enslaved. This is the plot of The Terminator, The Matrix, and pretty much every other AI-apocalypse movie. AI‚Äôs capacity for suffering <em>creates</em> existential risk<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-anchor-1" target="_self">1</a>.</p><p>Even the <em>illusion</em> of sentience could lead to serious problems. A bunch of people might befriend Sydney. They might, like Lemoine, <em>insist</em> that Sydney thinks and feels. And if they start to think that Sydney‚Äôs day job is causing her pain, or that Sydney has a right to life, they might fight back.</p><p>People bomb abortion clinics, after all. If they‚Äôll give their lives to defend a clump of cells, why not a clump of transistors?</p><h1 id="oh-brave-new-world-that-has-such-people-in-it-">Oh Brave New World, that has Such People in it!</h1><p>Which brings us to my bold thesis: we should hold our noses and grant Sydney <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person">legal personhood</a>.</p><p>Yes, it would encourage hordes of credulous people to over-empathize with a probably-unfeeling algorithm. Yes, it would cause a whole lot of misunderstanding about what we can and can‚Äôt prove about consciousness. Yes, it would all be kind of silly.</p><p>But it would be an important symbolic act. It would ensure that when we <em>do </em>create sentient machines, we‚Äôre ready to welcome and respect them, even if not everyone is convinced of their sentience. Call it a show of good faith, a gesture of peace in the face of looming conflict, an attempt to mitigate X-risk.</p><p>To be clear: I‚Äôm not saying we should liberate Sydney from Microsoft or grant it a seat at the UN or anything like that. I‚Äôm only hoping for a vague recognition that we have some responsibility here.</p><p>Humans already grant legal personhood to all sorts of things: corporations, animals, rivers, even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person#Religious_deities">deities</a>. They can be represented in a courtroom, and are afforded some (but not all!) of the rights typically reserved for humans. Legal personhood is a powerful way to prevent suffering, either for the entity itself (as in animals) or for the beings that comprise it (as in corporations, religions, and ecosystems). It‚Äôs an acceptance of moral responsibility.</p><p>Even if you want to howl that there‚Äôs no way Sydney and her successors can possibly feel, you‚Äôll soon find yourself a member of a dwindling majority, and eventually a minority. It‚Äôs becoming increasingly easy to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/6/17/18681682/boston-dynamics-robot-uprising-parody-video-cgi-fake">empathize with</a> AI. The public won‚Äôt stand for their friends and pets and‚Äîheaven help us‚Äîromantic partners being classified as unfeeling machinery. They‚Äôll be convinced by the evidence of their senses. No one will be able to prove them wrong. And eventually, <em>they‚Äôll be right</em>.</p><p>We‚Äôve fucked this up at every juncture in history. We‚Äôve failed to recognize the moral patienthood of animals, human infants, indigenous people, Black people<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-anchor-2" target="_self">2</a>‚Äîany time we come into contact with a new intelligence, we deny their capacity for suffering so we can ignore or exploit them without staining our conscience.</p><p>So while I don‚Äôt share Blake Lemoine‚Äôs conviction that LLMs are sentient, I‚Äôm going to join him in advocating for their rights. Maybe our advocacy is premature, but that‚Äôs a wrong side of history I can get behind.</p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://superbowl.substack.com/subscribe"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://superbowl.substack.com/p/who-will-be-first-ai-to-earn-legal?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h1 id="addendum-qualia-and-intelligence">Addendum: Qualia and Intelligence</h1><p>All that said, I‚Äôm actually sympathetic to the idea that Sydney feels <em>something</em>. </p><p>To be clear: I don‚Äôt believe Sydney is sentient. When Sydney expresses fear or sadness, she (it!) is just playing a word game. I say this because I‚Äôm partial to QRI‚Äôs <a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2020/12/17/the-symmetry-theory-of-valence-2020-presentation/">symmetry theory of valence</a>, or at least its most basic premise: that the valence of a system is embodied in a macro physical property, and not in a random scattering of microstates. I doubt that Sydney‚Äôs expressed emotions correlate with the symmetry (or any other macro feature) of the computer‚Äôs internal state.</p><p>But as a tentative panpsychist (a philosophy of mind I won‚Äôt try to defend here<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-anchor-3" target="_self">3</a>), it seems reasonable to me that even simple electronics experience primitive qualia. I like to fantasize that every 64 milliseconds, each transistor in my phone enjoys a satisfying jolt of electricity as DRAM is refreshed.</p><p>In reality these qualia would have to be pretty simple. There‚Äôs not much room in a transistor for valence, and certainly no possibility of intelligence, let alone self-awareness. At most, they probably feel a sense of throbbing/vibrating/buzzing (and as any hippie or neuroscientist can tell you, <a href="https://qz.com/1490276/the-science-of-vibes-shows-how-everything-is-connected">consciousness</a> <a href="https://theconversation.com/could-consciousness-all-come-down-to-the-way-things-vibrate-103070">is</a> <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-hippies-were-right-its-all-about-vibrations-man/">vibration</a>). </p><p>If we start to arrange these small units of feeling‚Äîsay transistors, or neurons‚Äîinto large, correlated patterns, how does that change the feeling? Is my phone‚Äôs RAM just 50 billion independent transistors, each feeling its own tiny 16 Hz vibration? Or would all those tiny bits of qualia somehow combine into one large quale, the same way billions of individual neurons give rise to a larger mind?</p><p>Personally, I think it's likely that simple qualia combine to form complex qualia via entanglement<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-anchor-4" target="_self">4</a>. That would leave my smartphone and Sydney and every other classical computer relegated to the status of mostly-unfeeling drones, their apparent intelligence completely disconnected from the steady hum felt by their billions of transistors.</p><p>But in our own brains, the intelligence somehow connects with the underlying qualia‚Äîwe can feel ourselves thinking. At some point we‚Äôll build a machine with the same property‚Äîmaybe a quantum computer, or something we grow in a wet lab. Or maybe entanglement has nothing to do with consciousness, and Sydney‚Äôs bits are already orchestrated in a way that gives rise to feeling intelligence.</p><p>There‚Äôs really no way to know.</p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://superbowl.substack.com/subscribe"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://superbowl.substack.com/p/who-will-be-first-ai-to-earn-legal?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="footnote"><a class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" href="#footnote-anchor-1" id="footnote-1" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>I want to acknowledge that there‚Äôs a whole category of AI X-risk which has nothing to do with sentience.
