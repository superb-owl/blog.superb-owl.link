Despite frequenting both popular and niche message boards, I’ve rarely created an account, let alone posted. Posting somehow felt both beneath and above me—there’s so much brilliance and nonsense in the comment section, and it’s hard to know where I’d fall in the spectrum.</p><p>I also complain constantly about the quality of online discussions. Recently, this has begun to strike me as a lazy and hypocritical take. If I want a better community, I should do my part and participate.</p><p>So I resolved to spend a month commenting on HN, with a loose goal of reaching 501 karma. While I managed to achieve this, my overall impact on the quality of discussion is up for debate. Let’s explore.</p><h3 id="outline">Outline</h3><ul><li><p>Karma Farming</p><ul><li><p>Why 501 Karma?</p></li><li><p>Anonymity</p></li><li><p>Quantity over Quality</p></li><li><p>The New Page</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The Data</p><ul><li><p>Scores</p></li><li><p>Replies</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Post Analysis</p><ul><li><p>The Good</p></li><li><p>The Bad</p></li><li><p>The Ugly</p></li></ul></li></ul><div class="subscription-widget-wrap"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"></p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input class="email-input" name="email" tabindex="-1" type="email"><input class="button primary" type="submit" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><h1 id="karma-farming">Karma Farming</h1><p>An explicit Karma goal might strike some long-time commenters as uncouth. It’s an easy system to game, and Karma-obsessed users can lead to a degradation in content by spamming and reposting popular content. But if social networks are going to gamify participation, it’s important to understand both the strategy and sportsmanship of playing the game. Here’s what I’ve learned.</p><h2 id="why-501-karma-">Why 501 Karma?</h2><p>Hacker News grants users <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/hacker-news-undocumented/blob/master/README.md">some extra features and privileges</a> as they climb the Karma ladder. Top prize is a downvote button at 501 Karma. It seemed like an achievable goal, with the added bonus that a downvote button would allow me to help moderate some of the worst comments.</p><h2 id="anonymity">Anonymity</h2><p>Choosing to post anonymously, rather than using my real name, made things much easier. I’ve occasionally commented under my real name, and am embarrassed looking back at my post history. There’s nothing terrible, but I’m sure some of my colleagues and friends have stumbled upon it and smirked. This might be projection or paranoia, but it causes enough anxiety to deter me from posting regularly.</p><p>With an anonymous account, I no longer have to do that “but what if…” pause before clicking <code>Submit</code>.</p><p>The obvious corollary here: don’t be a dick. Posting anonymously gives people the latitude to say things they’d never say to someone’s face. I’ve tried to rein myself in, but even so I notice the effect of the mask, and have had to edit more than one post for dickishness (see <strong>The Ugly</strong> below).</p><h2 id="quantity-over-quality">Quantity over Quality</h2><p>This stratagem seemingly runs counter to my mission of contributing productively. Let me explain.</p><p>My biggest impediment to posting is paralysis. I can stare at a comment section for half an hour, wondering which of my ideas to voice and how best to phrase it. So I’ve adopted <a href="https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/standard.html">Google’s advice on pull requests</a>: if it’s a net win, submit. Great is the enemy of good.</p><p>As we’ll see below, my complete inability to predict which posts would do well made this imperative. Twenty minutes spent agonizing over a parenthetical could earn me zero upvotes.</p><p>So the goal here isn’t to spam. It’s to focus on getting many reasonable ideas on the table, rather than a handful of perfectly shaped comments.</p><h2 id="the-new-page">The New Page</h2><p>It’s easy to get lost in comment threads with 100+ posts. Once the discussion takes off, there’s a feedback loop where the top posts get the most eyeballs, and therefore the most upvotes. New top-level comments will likely fall well below the fold.</p><p>I like to hang out on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newest">new page</a>, where the most recent posts come through. Honestly I was surprised at the level of quality here—on many sites it’s full of nonsense (but be sure that the <code>show dead</code> setting is turned off).</p><p>If a post catches your eye that already has 3+ upvotes, jump in! There’s a decent chance this post will hit the front page, and you’re likely to be the first commenter. Don’t forget to upvote it yourself.</p><p>Upvoting high-quality posts in <code>new</code> is also a great way to help the community. These are the real heroes, who sort through the firehose of posts and signal-boost the best ones, so the rest of us can lazily peruse the front page.</p><h1 id="the-data">The Data</h1><p>Enough strategy—let’s see how I performed.</p><p>Here’s a visualization of my posts over time, showing how many points each one got:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40d94597-8172-4aca-8afa-96c961295254_1912x984.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp"><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="749" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40d94597-8172-4aca-8afa-96c961295254_1912x984.png" width="1456"><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2" fill="none" height="16" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Comment scores over time</figcaption></figure></div><p>Between June 8th and July 19th, I created 135 posts, an average of 3.3 posts per day. I’m honestly surprised at this level of engagement—I’ve never posted nearly this frequently, and it didn’t feel like that much.</p><p>You can see I was most active at the beginning, and my average score didn’t improve much over time, if at all. This too surprised me—I thought I’d easily figure out what does and doesn’t click after a week or two.</p><h2 id="scores">Scores</h2><p>My top post (see <strong>The Good</strong> below) got 104 points, and the worst (see <strong>The Bad</strong>) got downvoted to the lowest possible score of -4 points.

I hope some of these regulations spill over into the U.S. and the rest of the world.</code></pre><p></p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31642073">On corporate misbehavior</a> (57 points, 34 descendants)</p><pre><code>There's definitely a trend where large corporations/institutions push risk and liability down onto individuals, who have a hard time quantifying it properly. They make promises about "independence" and "entrepreneurship" and "building wealth", but they're really just taking advantage of an information asymmetry, tricking uninformed individuals into accepting a deal that is much worse than they think.

See: Uber, Subway franchises, academia, Amazon truck drivers, or any of your classic MLMs</code></pre><p></p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31771058">On tech monopolies</a> (27 points, 49 descendants)</p><pre><code>The vertical monopolies enjoyed by tech behemoths are absurd.

Here’s one calling for a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31914312">change in how we build user-centric applications</a>, which kicked off some good discussion (49 points, 38 descendants):</p><pre><code>I'd love to see "sync with git" become a standard app feature.
Too many app developers realize they need some kind of shared state "in the cloud" and end up with a database and a backend server. Many of them would be better off if they had a reliable way to push the state management to a user-controlled space, like a git repo or Dropbox</code></pre><p>and one that <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31667535">surfaces an item of trivia</a> that appears to be underreported (20 points, 11 descendants):</p><pre><code>I had the pleasure of visiting the DDR Museum in Berlin [1] last month. I expected it to be about all the atrocities/hardship/etc but it was mainly a pleasant description of day-to-day life.
The thing I found the most amusing was the description of nude beaches. Apparently it was a point of tension between the Soviets and the Germans, but the Germans just kept getting naked and the Soviets gave up trying to police it. I can't find any great online descriptions of it, but this [2] seems to do a decent job.

There must be some straightforward cryptographic scheme that would make this kind of tampering impossible.</code></pre><p></p><h2 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h2><p>As I mentioned above, the mask of anonymity led me to post a little more flippantly than I might under my real name.</p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31948222">Here’s a snarky post</a> (2 points, 0 descendants) in response to someone complaining about GitHub :</p><pre><code>Move to GitLab</code></pre><p>In my defense, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31947839">the other comments are worse</a>, and the original post has been removed.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32159824">another that I rewrote several times</a>, in response to a user complaining that Netflix programming is too oriented towards social justice (1 point, 0 descendants):</p><pre><code>&gt; social justice tinged

Check out the Dave Chappelle controversy. Likely that will change your opinion of Netflix as a PC-obsessed company.</code></pre><p>I think my first response was something like</p><pre><code>&gt; social justice tinged
