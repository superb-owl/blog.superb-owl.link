    <p><em>Minus the Nonsense is a series on valuable ideas that have been tainted by magical thinking. We’ll try to distill the good parts—the parts compatible with a scientific worldview—from the woo. Past subjects include <a href="/p/jungian-psychology-minus-the-nonsense">Jungian Psychology</a>. Future subjects will include Karma, Panpsychism, and Enlightenment.</em></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://superbowl.substack.com/subscribe"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Taoism is a cornerstone of Eastern philosophy. Its founder, Laozi, holds a role analogous to Socrates or Aristotle; texts like the <em>Tao Te Ching</em> and the <em>Zhuangzi</em> show a sophisticated understanding of how language, culture, and reality intertwine.</p><p>But much like the (roughly contemporaneous) ideas of Greek philosophy, Taoism grew out of an enchanted worldview. Over two millennia it has evolved into a strange mixture of philosophy, cosmology, alchemy, meditation, sex magic, and alternative medicine. The New Age movement’s adoption and distortion of Taoist ideas only complicates the situation.</p><p>Much like Christianity, contemporary Taoism bears only a surface-level resemblance to its foundational texts. Let’s see what we can learn by looking at the source.</p><h2 id="outline">Outline</h2><ul><li><p><a href="#the-eternal-tao">The Eternal Tao</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#yin-and-yang">Yin and Yang</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#non-duality">Non-Duality</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#get-out-of-the-wei">Get out of the Wei</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#the-nonsense">The Nonsense</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#the-way-you-can-go">The Way You Can Go</a></p></li></ul><p><em>This essay participates in a hallowed Western tradition: appropriating Eastern religious concepts. My goal isn’t to educate the reader about Taoism, but to point to interesting ideas using Taoism as a lens. In the process, I’m going divorce some of its deepest insights from their cultural and historical context. Take this as a preemptive apology to any practicing Taoists or Taoist scholars out there. </em></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://superbowl.substack.com/subscribe"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h1 id="the-eternal-tao">The Eternal Tao</h1><blockquote><p>The way you can go<br>isn’t the real way.<br>The name you can say<br>isn’t the real name.</p><p>—Opening lines of the <em>Tao Te Ching</em>, as rendered<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-anchor-1" target="_self">1</a> by Ursula K. Le Guin</p></blockquote><p><em>Tao</em> sits at the root of the Taoist universe. Though it’s often translated as “way”, there’s no English equivalent—even in Chinese it has a variety of meanings. For now, it’s best to let this word sit vacuous, devoid of a referent. Better to infer its meaning through exposure.</p><h2 id="goblet-words">Goblet Words</h2><p>This is a common practice in Taoist discourse. The philosophers call these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblet_word">goblet words</a>, named after a wine vessel which tips over when full, and stands upright when empty. Attaching a single concrete meaning to any word is an easy way to get lost when reading Taoist texts.</p><blockquote><p>Words are not just wind. Words have something to say. But if what they have to say is not fixed, then do they really say something? Or do they say nothing? People suppose that words are different from the peeps of baby birds, but is there any difference, or isn’t there?</p><p>—the <em>Zhuangzi</em>, as translated by Burton Watson</p></blockquote><p>For Western students of philosophy, this is jarring, even offensive—we expect philosophers to define their terms with rigor, ideally by putting a glossary in the first chapter. But Taoist philosophy looks and feels more like poetry or fiction, where double meanings and ambiguity <em>serve</em> rather than detract from the author’s intentions.</p><p>It’d be a mistake to dismiss Taoism because it doesn’t play by our rules. The Taoists are deeply skeptical of language and attuned to its inadequacies—it should be no surprise to find this ambivalence reflected in their style of communication.</p><p>And as the verse above states, the inadequacy of language is particularly severe when it comes to <em>Tao</em>.</p><h2 id="via-negativa">Via Negativa</h2><p>Nothing can be said about the <em>Tao</em>. The second you attach a description to it, you’ve left something out. If you call it big, you deny its smallness; if you call it important, you deny its triviality<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-anchor-2" target="_self">2</a>.</p><p>If this seems evasive, I like to translate the verse above as:</p><blockquote><p>Nothing can be said about everything.</p></blockquote><p>This formulation is a little easier to swallow—sentences like “everything is big” or “everything is important” are plainly false.</p><p>“Everything” is a pretty poor translation of <em>Tao</em> though. <em>Tao</em> is is more like a verb-y version of “everything”, the all-process. My favorite image of <em>Tao</em> is the Hamiltonian of the universe<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-anchor-3" target="_self">3</a>.</p><p>But again, treat <em>Tao</em> as a goblet word. Know that it sits at the root of Taoist ontology and let its exact definition remain vague. If you start to feel like you have a solid understanding of what <em>Tao</em> is, shake your head and <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?EmptyYourCup">empty your cup</a>.</p><h1 id="yin-and-yang">Yin and Yang</h1><p>So nothing can be said about everything. Should we leave it at that?</p><p>A Taoist master would probably say yes, toss their copy of the <em>Tao Te Ching</em> in a lake, and admire its sinking with meditative absorption. But <em>we</em> have to contend with mundane reality, with “the ten thousand things” that appear around us. And fortunately Taoism offers a framework for doing so.</p><p>Taoism grants us a foothold by cutting <em>Tao</em> in half.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70f4d6c9-9e50-4531-b821-c15738b58630_4000x1920.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp"><img alt="A yin-yang symbol.

I could give you typical translations of these words, but once again it’s better to leave them vacuous, and to intuit their meanings through exposure.</p><blockquote><p>Heaven [yang] and earth [yin]<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-anchor-4" target="_self">4</a><br>begin in the unnamed:<br>name’s the mother<br>of the ten thousand things.</p><p>—Second stanza of the <em>Tao Te Ching</em></p></blockquote><p>Every concept is divided into one of these two categories, usually in pairs of opposites. Light is <em>yang</em> and darkness is <em>yin</em>; activity is <em>yang</em> and passivity is <em>yin</em>; up is <em>yang</em> and down is <em>yin</em>; odd numbers are <em>yang</em> and evens are <em>yin; </em>the sun is <em>yang</em> and the moon is <em>yin</em>.</p><p>(Importantly, masculinity is <em>yang</em> while femininity is <em>yin</em>. We’ll talk about the implications of this below, and how feminists like Le Guin handled it. In the meantime, I’ll leave you with a fun mnemonic: if you struggle to remember which is <em>yin</em> and which is <em>yang</em>, I like to note that <em>yang</em> rhymes with “wang” or “dong”, depending how you say it.)</p><p>Dividing the ineffable Tao into <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em> gives us conceptual categories we can work with. In contrast with <em>Tao</em>, <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em> are hyper-describable.</p><h1 id="non-duality">Non-Duality</h1><p>The great insight of Taoism is that the division of <em>Tao</em> into <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em> is not real. It’s useful, but it’s a useful <em>fiction</em>.</p><p>By extension, this applies to every concept, to all ten thousand things.</p><p>We use words like “light” and “masculine” and “up” with the sense that they exist in some tangible, separate sense. But none of these <em>yang</em> words can exist without its <em>yin</em> partner. There can’t be “up” without “down” or “light” without “dark”; if there weren’t any men, we wouldn’t just be a single-sex species—we’d be sexless. There’d be no need to distinguish “woman” from “person”.</p><blockquote><p>Everybody on earth knowing<br>that beauty is beautiful<br>makes ugliness.</p><p>Everybody knowing<br>that goodness is good<br>makes wickedness.</p><p>For being and non-being<br>arise together;<br>hard and easy<br>complete each other;<br>long and short<br>shape each other;<br>high and low<br>depend on each other;<br>note and voice<br>make the music together;<br>before and after<br>follow each other.</p><p>—Chapter 2 of the <em>Tao Te Ching</em></p></blockquote><p>What exists <em>out there</em>, independent of humanity and its concepts, is a continuum, an undifferentiated whole. With words, we cut the continuum in half and name both ends differently, giving us the sense that they’re separate. “Name is the mother of the ten thousand things.”</p><p>But <em>we’re not actually cutting anything</em>. The words delude us into thinking one thing is actually two.</p><blockquote><p>…the sage debates but does not discriminate. So those who divide fail to divide; those who discriminate fail to discriminate. What does this mean, you ask? The sage embraces things. Ordinary men discriminate among them and parade their discriminations before others. So I say, those who discriminate fail to see...If the Way is made clear, it is not the Way. If discriminations are put into words, they do not suffice.</p><p>—the <em>Zhuangzi</em></p></blockquote><p>But there’s an even deeper sense of non-duality in Taoism: things not only <em>pair</em> with their opposite—they <em>contain </em>their opposite. Le Guin calls this “one of those counterintuitive truths that, when the mind can accept them, suddenly double the size of the universe.”</p><blockquote><p>Hollowed out,<br>clay makes a pot.<br>Where the pot’s not<br>is where it’s useful.</p><p>Cut doors and windows<br>to make a room.<br>Where the room isn’t,<br>there’s room for you.</p><p>—Chapter 11 of the <em>Tao Te Ching</em></p></blockquote><p>The interplay of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em> in all things is integral to the Taoist worldview. So much so that it’s encoded in Taoism’s most recognizable symbol: the yin-yang pictured above. The <em>yin</em> koi has a <em>yang</em> eye, and vice versa—the opposites not only stand side by side, they’re intermixed.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa309b81-9c68-4f6e-a429-70f4002f77c7_1200x600.gif" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp"><img alt="A gif zooming into a yin-yang, where every eye contains another yin-yang" class="sizing-normal" height="600" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa309b81-9c68-4f6e-a429-70f4002f77c7_1200x600.gif" title="A gif zooming into a yin-yang, where every eye contains another yin-yang" width="1200"><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2 " fill="none" height="16" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">This idea has led to some amazing fractal renditions of the yin-yang. <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6636796-Recursive-Yin-Yang-Loop">Source</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The easiest way for me to illustrate this is through gender.</p><p>As noted above, Taoism puts masculinity in the <em>yang</em> (wang!) bucket, and femininity in the <em>yin</em> bucket. A facile reading of this is flatly sexist—it literally labels men as superior and women as inferior. But with a full understanding of non-duality, we get a picture much closer to contemporary gender attitudes.</p><p>Throughout Taoist literature, it’s made clear that every person has <em>both</em> <em>yin </em>and <em>yang </em>aspects. The highest goal is to balance these two energies. Mature men and women are neither <em>yin</em> nor <em>yang</em>—they hold the two in balance. The enlightened Taoist is gender-fluid<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-anchor-5" target="_self">5</a>.</p><p>We might say that <em>immature</em> men tend to be yang-heavy, and immature women yin-heavy. This isn’t always the case—there are plenty of tomboys and effeminate men who buck the trend. But no matter how stereotypically feminine or masculine a person is, the great insight of Taoism is that they’re still connected to the opposing force, and capable of moving towards balance.</p><p>And according to Taoism, that’s exactly what we should be doing.</p><h1 id="get-out-of-the-wei">Get out of the Wei</h1><p>There’s a paradox at the heart of most religions. According to Christianity, people are created by a perfect God, but they’re inclined to sin; in Buddhism all beings have Buddha-nature, but they’re inclined toward ignorance. Nature is perfect, but somehow humanity—a product of nature—mars the perfection.</p><p>Taoism is no different. The <em>Tao</em> itself is eternal and unperturbed, but people, places, and even whole nations can “fall out” of the Tao—usually by becoming <a href="/p/beware-the-variable-maximizers">fixated on some particular ideal or goal</a>.</p><blockquote><p>In the degradation of the great way<br>come benevolence and righteousness.<br>With the exaltation of learning and prudence<br>comes immense hypocrisy.<br>The disordered family<br>is full of dutiful children and parents.<br>The disordered society<br>is full of loyal patriots.</p><p>—Chapter 18 of the <em>Tao Te Ching</em></p></blockquote><p>When we become wildly imbalanced towards one side of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>—usually towards <em>yang</em>—we invite disaster. Much of the <em>Tao Te Ching</em> encourages us to embrace <em>yin</em>.</p><blockquote><p>Nothing in the world<br>is as soft, as weak, as water;<br>nothing else can wear away <br>the hard, the strong,<br>and remain unaltered.<br>Soft overcomes hard,<br>weak overcomes strong.<br>Everybody knows it,<br>nobody uses the knowledge.<br>…<br>Right words sound wrong.</p><p>—Chapter 78 of the <em>Tao Te Ching</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Tao</em> itself is often analogized with water or a river. I like to picture something that’s fallen “out” of the <em>Tao</em> as an eddy in that river—a disturbance which causes the water to break from the current, or even to push momentarily upstream.</p><p>Given how easy it is to lose the <em>Tao</em>, and how disastrous the consequences are, Taoist texts are full of advice on how to stay on the path.</p><p>Taoist morality doesn’t resemble that of a typical religion, in that it doesn’t really outlaw or promote specific behaviors—it seems assumed that good behavior will follow naturally from aligning with the <em>Tao</em>. But there are a few core values, like simple living (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu_(Taoism)">pu</a></em>), spontaneity (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziran">ziran</a></em>), and effortlessness (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei">wu wei</a></em>).</p><p>This last one is particularly important, given how frequently we lose ourselves in <em>yang</em> striving.</p><blockquote><p>Over and over Lao Tzu says <em>wei wu wei</em>: Do not do. Doing not-doing. To act without acting. Action by inaction. You do nothing, yet it gets done…</p><p>It’s not a statement susceptible to logical interpretation, or even to a syntactical translation into English; but it’s a concept that transforms thought radically, that changes minds. The whole book is both an explanation and a demonstration of it.</p><p>—Ursula K. Le Guin, commentary on the <em>Tao Te Ching</em></p></blockquote><h1 id="the-nonsense">The Nonsense</h1><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://superbowl.substack.com/subscribe"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h2 id="the-zhuangzi">The Zhuangzi</h2><p>I can’t help but start this section off with the <em>Zhuangzi</em>. This book is delightfully, deliberately absurd. Master Zhuang’s closest Western relative is probably Lewis Carroll. Here’s a sample:</p><blockquote><p>There is being. There is nonbeing. There is a not yet beginning to be nonbeing. There is a not yet beginning to be a not yet beginning to be nonbeing. Suddenly there is being and nonbeing. But between this being and nonbeing, I don’t really know which is being and which is nonbeing. Now I have just said something. But I don’t know whether what I have said has really said something or whether it hasn’t said something.</p></blockquote><p>The book is full of nonsense and wordplay. It’s wildly entertaining even in English, where I’m sure half the humor is missing. But much like Carroll’s work, its whimsy shouldn’t mislead us into thinking it’s trivial—the book demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of philosophy.</p><p>You’re probably familiar with this parable:</p><blockquote><p>Once Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn’t know he was Zhuang Zhou. Suddenly he woke up, and there he was, solid and unmistakable Zhuang Zhou. But he didn’t know if he were Zhuang Zhou who had dreamed he was a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuang Zhou. Between Zhuang Zhou and a butterfly, there must be some distinction! This is called the Transformation of Things.</p><p>—the <em>Zhuangzi</em></p></blockquote><p>While the <em>Zhuangzi</em> is full of magic and wonder, it’s clear that the author is using nonsense to make a point.</p><h2 id="qi">Qi</h2><p><em>Qi</em> is literally translated as “breath”, but represents something more fundamental—a flow of vital energy through the body. It’s been analogized with the Hindu concept of <em>prana</em> and (with a bit more of a stretch) the Christian concept of Holy Spirit.</p><p>This is the best way I can define my own understanding of <em>qi</em>: the common factor underlying the activity of your respiratory, circulatory, and nervous systems.</p><p>There’s no place for <em>qi</em> in Western medicine, and it’s widely seen as pseudoscience. This hasn’t stopped some from trying to “prove” its existence.</p><p>To some degree, this is a semantic problem—what a qigong expert might point to as <em>qi</em>, his physician will call his pulse or tingling digital nerves. <em>Qi</em> stands for a wide range of body rhythms which Western medicine has developed a detailed taxonomy for. And the Western taxonomy is much better at curing illness.</p><p>That said, the subjective, felt presence of <em>qi</em> is undeniable—<em>qi</em>-like sensations have been reported by contemplatives from a wide range of cultures. And while medical professionals might not have much use for them, the skillful manipulation of those sensations can create a <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/152738/">deeper sense of well-being</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229915000825">alleviate depression</a>.</p><p>So while we shouldn’t treat <em>qi</em> as objectively real, it can be a useful concept. A goblet word, if you will.</p><h2 id="alternative-medicine">Alternative Medicine</h2><p>Taoist medicine developed a vast, intricate system for discussing and improving physical health. It resembles some early prototypes of Western medicine, including the Ancient Greek concept of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism">four humors</a>. Major concepts include <em>hun</em> and <em>po</em> (the <em>yang</em> and <em>yin</em> elements in the body) and the meridians of acupuncture (which are channels for the flow of <em>qi</em>).</p><p>While Taoist medical concepts certainly led to a lot of nutty superstitions and behaviors (as we’ll see below), they mostly focus on things like breathing exercises, diet, and physical movement. Taken as a supplement to—and not a replacement for—Western medicine, Taoist medicine is probably mostly harmless.</p><h2 id="alchemy">Alchemy</h2><p>Much like Medieval alchemy in Europe, Taoist alchemy is a mix of internal (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neidan">neidan</a></em>) and external (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waidan">waidan</a></em>) practices. </p><p>Externally, the goal was the same as in Europe: to synthesize gold from base metals. The Taoists believed that eating this gold would confer immortality. The methodology was similar too: a highly esoteric set of instructions for burning, distilling, and condensing various substances, transmitted via an oral tradition and obscurantist texts.</p><p>Internal alchemy was focused on the proper circulation of <em>qi</em>, with the goal of prolonging life, or ensuring an eternal life after death. It mainly consists of breathing and meditation exercises, which many still find helpful today<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-6" id="footnote-anchor-6" target="_self">6</a>.</p><h2 id="magic-powers">Magic Powers</h2><p>Over millennia, Taoist masters have become wrapped in mythos. Laozi is said to have become immortal or a god.</p><p>Both the <em>Zhuangzi</em> and the <em>Liezi</em> (a lesser-known, but foundational Taoist text) mention <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xian_(Taoism)">xian</a></em>, humans who have superpowers or immortality. They seem to use <em>xian</em> in a metaphorical way, but later texts begin to take the idea literally. One claims that the author of the <em>Liezi</em> “could ride the wind and go soaring around with cool and breezy skill”; another <em>xian</em> supposedly rides a flying dragon.</p><p>There’s an implication that any student who trains hard enough can become a <em>xian</em> and attain these powers. Big if true.</p><h2 id="sex-stuff">Sex Stuff</h2><p>One of the strangest branches of Taoist medicine is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoist_sexual_practices">focused on sex</a>. It’s easy to see why heterosexual sex is an important symbol for Taoists: it’s a literal joining of <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>, a reuniting of heaven and earth.</p><p>It’s thought that sex is a way to transmute <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jing_(Chinese_medicine)">jing</a></em> into <em>qi</em>, thereby restoring your life force. Methods vary—there’s a focus on semen retention, but some see retrograde ejaculation as nourishing. Some texts describe sex as symbiotic; others as a battle between man and woman, with a lot of fretting about how to retain your own power while absorbing your partner’s (a common tactic is to selfishly make your partner orgasm before you do).</p><p>Unsurprisingly, things got out of hand—as we like to say here, mixing sex and religion is <a href="/p/church-of-reality-schrodinger-believed#%C2%A7the-universal-mind">dangerous</a>. Some Taoist authors refer to their multiple female partners as cooking vessels, or even “the enemy”. One major text recommends sleeping with many virgins, particularly premenstrual 14-year-olds, as a way of attaining immortality.</p><p>I hope we can all agree this is nonsense.</p><h1 id="the-way-you-can-go">The Way You Can Go</h1><blockquote><p>The truth is one and the same everywhere and I must say that Taoism is one of the most perfect formulations of it I ever became acquainted with.</p><p>—C. G. Jung</p></blockquote><p>Taoism’s power lies in its skeptical attitude towards reason and language. It understands precisely what gets lost when we carve up the world into discrete, nameable chunks.</p><p>But then it proceeded to carve up the world and get lost in the chunks.</p><p>We should doubt any positive assertion made in the name of Taoism, whether it’s as simple as “the circulation of <em>qi</em> is important for health” or as ludicrous as “eating synthesized gold will make you immortal”. Even abstract notions like “the way you can go isn’t the real way” should be met with suspicion.</p><p>Doing so doesn’t weaken Taoism—it merely takes Taoism on its own terms.</p><p>When it comes to concrete problems of morality, logic, or health, we should lean on purpose-built models. Even in fields like semiotics or epistemology, where Taoism has made large contributions, we should fall back to domain-specific philosophies.</p><p>Taoism is best seen as a meta-philosophy. It can’t give us any concrete answers, and the answers it does give are—by its own rules—vague and untrustworthy. But it can help us escape from the narrow-mindedness that always comes with specialization. Taoism shows us, over and over, that every useful system of thought is blind to at least half the world.</p><p>Taoism won’t help you prevent cancer or change your oil. But it <em>can</em> help you move through life with grace and spontaneity. The moment we become too invested in one line of thinking, or begin to feel certain that we’ve uncovered the capital-t Truth, Taoism reminds us:</p><p>Empty your cup.</p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://superbowl.substack.com/subscribe"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://superbowl.substack.com/p/taoism-minus-the-nonsense?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="footnote"><a class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false" href="#footnote-anchor-1" id="footnote-1" target="_self">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>To call Le Guin’s version of the Tao Te Ching a translation would be misleading—she knew little Chinese.
