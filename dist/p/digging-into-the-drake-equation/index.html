Here’s a simplified version:</p><pre><code>N = R * n * F * L</code></pre><p>Where:</p><ul><li><p><code>R</code> is the average rate of star formation</p></li><li><p>n is the average number of planets per star that might support life</p></li><li><p><code>F</code> is the fraction of viable planets where intelligent life actually grows at some point</p></li><li><p><code>L</code> is the average lifetime of technological civilizations</p></li></ul><p>The original Drake Equation has some more intermediate terms, but you get the idea.</p><h2 id="interpretations">Interpretations</h2><p><strong>Results for </strong><code>N</code><strong> vary widely based on assumptions</strong> made about the individual parameters. </p><p><strong>Astronomy has led to fairly accurate determination of some values</strong>: we know <code>R</code> (the rate of star formation) is about 1.5-3 stars per year, and some basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone">assumptions</a> about habitability put <code>n</code> (the number of habitable planets per star) at about .4.</p><p><code>L</code>, the average lifetime of a technological civilization, is an interesting value, which we at least have a little data for: humanity has so far lasted a century or so as a technological species. <strong>Low values for </strong><code>L</code><strong> are effectively predictions that humanity will exterminate itself</strong> (e.g. through nuclear war or climate disaster) before we become interplanetary.</p><p>But <strong>the value of </strong><code>F</code><strong>—the fraction of habitable planets that go on to develop intelligent life—is anyone’s guess</strong>. We have only one datapoint: Earth. This hasn’t stopped scientists from trying though—some have tried to extrapolate its values from the evolutionary timeline on Earth or the apparent lack of a second <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis">abiogenesis</a>. Estimates range from tiny fractions small to nearly 100%.</p><h1 id="an-alternative-approach">An Alternative Approach</h1><p>Rather than trying to estimate <code>F</code> from limited data, we can turn the question around a bit: given a particular probability of life evolving around a star, what are the odds we’d be the only ones here? I.e. <strong>how likely is it that intelligent life evolved </strong><em><strong>exactly</strong></em><strong> once</strong> within our galaxy, or within the Universe as a whole?</p><p>It’s fairly straightforward to calculate the expected number of civilizations given a certain probability of life evolving around a star. We can think of a large k-sided die—if the die lands on 1, you get life; any other value yields nothing. Then we just have to roll the die once for each star.</p><h2 id="a-coin-flip">A Coin Flip</h2><p>To start with an easy example, let’s use a coin (i.e. a 2-sided die). If we flip the coin S times, <strong>what are the odds we only get a single Heads?</strong></p><p>Working manually:</p><ul><li><p>S=1 → 50% (it will either land Heads or Tails)</p></li><li><p>S=2 → 50% (HT and TH work, out of the 4 possible combinations)</p></li><li><p>S=3 → 37.5% (HTT, THT, or TTH out of the 12 possible combinations)</p></li></ul><p>In general, there are <code>2^S</code> possible flip sequences, and there are <code>S</code> ways to get exactly one Heads (in the first spot, the second spot, …or the Sth spot). So the general formula is</p><pre><code>P = S/2^S</code></pre><p>I.e. if we flip a coin S times, <strong>we can expect to get exactly one Heads with probability </strong><code>S/2^S</code><strong>.</strong></p><p>We know there are about 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, or about 2^26. Plug that in for S and we get</p><pre><code>P = 2^26 / 2^(2^26)
  = 1 / 2^ (2^26 - 26)</code></pre><p>where P is the probability we’d find ourselves alone.</p><p>This is such an outrageously tiny number I can’t find a calculator that will handle it. Suffice it to say, <strong>if there were 50/50 odds of life evolving around a given star, the Milky Way would be teeming with life</strong> (about 50 billion civilizations!)</p><h2 id="lowering-the-odds">Lowering the Odds</h2><p>But the emergence of life around a star is probably a rarer event than that. <strong>What happens if we increase the number of sides on our die?</strong></p><p>A three-sided die gives us a slightly more complex expression. There are now <code>3^S</code> total possible combinations, but many more than <code>S</code> ways to only roll a single 1. For example, if we get a 1 on the first roll, we can get any combination of 2s and 3s from then on. There are <code>2^(S-1)</code> such combinations of 2s and 3s, giving us the equation:</p><pre><code>P = S * 2^(S-1) / 3^S</code></pre><p>We can generalize this to any k-sided die as</p><pre><code>P = S * (k-1)^(S-1) / k^S</code></pre><p>and voila! Given any probability of life evolving around a star, and the knowledge that there are 10B stars in the Milky Way, <strong>we can calculate the odds of humanity being alone</strong>.</p><p>(Note: I wrote a quick <a href="https://go.dev/play/p/R2WSsW8Vmlb">simulation</a> to double-check this formula.)</p><h2 id="interrogating-the-formula">Interrogating the Formula</h2><p>Here’s an interesting question: <strong>given a certain number of stars S, what value of k </strong><em><strong>maximizes </strong></em><strong>the chances that humanity is alone?</strong></p><p>Let’s graph the equation for P as a function of S and k:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63ba3bbc-98ab-42aa-af88-2e710420f110_1798x1180.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp"><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="956" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63ba3bbc-98ab-42aa-af88-2e710420f110_1798x1180.png" width="1456"><div class="image-link-expand"><svg class="lucide lucide-maximize2" fill="none" height="16" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>We can see a clear maximum along the line <code>S=k</code>, which matches my intuition—you’d want to roll a D20 about 20 times to get exactly one 1. But can we prove this?</p><p>First we need to take the derivative of P with respect to k:</p><pre><code>P' = S * [k^-S*(S-1)*(k-1)^S-2 - S*k^(-S-1)*(k-1)^(S-1)]</code></pre><p>Then set it to zero:</p><pre><code>0 = k^-S*(S-1)*(k-1)^S-2 - S*k^(-S-1)*(k-1)^(S-1)
k^-S*(S-1)*(k-1)^S-2 = S*k^(-S-1)*(k-1)^(S-1)
(S-1)(k-1)^(S-2)     = S * k * (k-1)^(S-1)
S/k     = (S-1)/(k-1)
S/(S-1) = k/(k-1)
k = S</code></pre><p>So if we have 10B stars, a one-in-ten-billion chance of life forming around a star would maximize the chances of humanity being alone.</p><p>But here’s what’s fascinating: with the numbers perfectly fine-tuned, we only have about a 37% chance of being alone! <strong>Even if we handicap the odds as much as possible, it’d be </strong><em><strong>more likely than not</strong></em><strong> for humanity to have a sibling.</strong></p><p>To put it another way, if you’re going to create a galaxy (or Universe) as big as ours, there’s no way for you to fine-tune the probability of life forming to make it happen <em>exactly</em> once, with any reasonable odds. At most you can get to a roughly one-in-three chance.</p><h2 id="to-infinity">To Infinity</h2><p>You may have noticed from the graph above that <strong>our function appears to be converging towards some limit</strong> as the number of stars grows. In fact it does, and it’s a pretty elegant one!</p><p>First, let’s find the limit when <code>S=k</code>—i.e. the case where the odds of intelligent life emerging are fine-tuned to maximize the chances of only one civilization. I’ll skip the derivation (read: I can’t figure it out) and let WolframAlpha <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=limit+calculator&amp;assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22Limit%22%2C+%22limit%22%7D+-%3E%22infinity%22&amp;assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22Limit%22%2C+%22limitfunction%22%7D+-%3E%22x*%28x-1%29%5E%28x-1%29%2Fx%5Ex%22">do the work</a> for me:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa46f2748-9422-424f-81ae-e19015dd59b1_320x110.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp"><img alt="limit as S -> infinity of our equation with S=k is equal to 1/e" class="sizing-normal" height="110" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa46f2748-9422-424f-81ae-e19015dd59b1_320x110.png" title="limit as S -> infinity of our equation with S=k is equal to 1/e" width="320"><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>So with infinitely many stars, and an infinitesimal chance of life forming, we’d expect to see a single civilization about 36.8% of the time.

So <strong>there’s still a pretty wide range of values that could feasibly lead to a lonely humanity</strong>. But again, <em>any</em> value would on average yield at least one or two siblings.</p><h1 id="caveats">Caveats</h1><h2 id="humanity-could-be-a-fluke">Humanity Could be a Fluke</h2><p>There’s one major flaw in the reasoning above: <strong>we can simply tune the probability of life forming to be extremely low, and count humanity as a fluke</strong>. Then we’d almost certainly be alone in the universe.</p><p>How much weight should we give to this possibility? Given that we’re here, can we make <em>any</em> assumptions about the probability of life forming, other than it being non-zero?</p><p>I’m pretty sure there’s a Bayesian vs Frequentist debate to be had here, but I’d need to spend a lot more time thinking about it.</p><h2 id="existence-does-not-imply-contact">Existence does not imply Contact</h2><p>The Drake equation focuses on determining the odds of humanity <em>contacting</em> another civilization. The above just focuses on their hypothetical <em>existence.</em></p><p><strong>If we want to talk about the possibility of contact, we would need to add back in parameters</strong> for <code>L</code> (the average lifetime of technological civilizations) and <code>R</code> (the rate of star formation). Wikipedia suggests <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation#Modifications">some other parameters</a> that might be helpful as well.</p><h2 id="the-universe-is-way-bigger-than-the-milky-way">The Universe is Way Bigger than the Milky Way</h2><p>There are about as many galaxies in the Universe as there are stars in the Milky Way. So the total number of stars is something like 10^22.</p><p>We could make a similar argument to the one above, fine-tuning <code>k</code> or <code>r</code> to maximize the chances of only one civilization appearing in the universe. The same logic would still anticipate two or three civilizations forming, but <strong>would almost guarantee that each galaxy would have at most one civilization</strong>. Worse, each of those civilizations could follow the logic above to claim that they likely have some siblings in their galaxy!</p><p>A lot of the discussion around these numbers gets confusing and contradictory because we only have a single datapoint to extrapolate from. <strong>We’ll never come to any firm ground</strong> until we either meet aliens, or explore our neighboring stars thoroughly enough to convince ourselves they’re lifeless. Then we could at least start putting some bounds on <code>F</code>. Until then, we can only torture the numbers and listen to their false confessions.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption"></p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input class="email-input" name="email" tabindex="-1" type="email"><input class="button primary" type="submit" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p>P.S.—Substack, please add MathJax or LaTeX support!</p><h2 id="related">Related</h2><div class="embedded-post-wrap"><a class="embedded-post" href="https://superbowl.substack.com/p/uap-evidence-summary-skepticism-and?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_campaign=post_embed&amp;utm_medium=web"><div class="embedded-post-header"><img class="embedded-post-publication-logo" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_56,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2dc69925-91e5-4348-a20a-21dccd7c0f28_1024x1024.png"><span class="embedded-post-publication-name">Superb Owl</span></div><div class="embedded-post-title-wrapper"><div class="embedded-post-title">The U.S. military is growing concerned about UFOs.
