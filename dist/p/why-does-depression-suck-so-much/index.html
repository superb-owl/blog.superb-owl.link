    <p>Sometimes I get depressed.</p><p>It happens maybe once every 3-5 years. Typically it lasts days to months. The impact can be anywhere from mild to debilitating.</p><p>Over the years, I’ve built up a robust set of skills and coping mechanisms. But each time the depression hits, it still consumes me. There’s something particularly insidious about the depressive mind.</p><p>Having recently gone through another round, I’d like to record my experience. I hope it might help others, or at least my future self.</p><h2 id="outline">Outline</h2><ul><li><p><a href="#is-this-gonna-be-forever">Is this gonna be forever</a>?<a href="#is-this-gonna-be-forever"></a><a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-anchor-1" target="_self">1</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#aberrant-beliefs">Aberrant Beliefs</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#anhedonia">Anhedonia</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#perverse-incentives">Perverse Incentives</a></p></li></ul><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://superbowl.substack.com/subscribe"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h1 id="is-this-gonna-be-forever-">Is this gonna be forever?</h1><p>For me, the defining feature of depression is a sense of permanence.</p><p>Mere sadness, by comparison, is extremely tolerable. When I’m merely sad, I can imagine what it’ll be like for the sadness to lift. I can remember what joy feels like, and I can imagine a future where I’m happy and laughing. I almost <em>enjoy</em> the sadness—it leaves me with a sense of contrast and wholeness.</p><p>In depression, the sadness feels permanent. Actually, “sadness” doesn’t quite capture the feeling—the word <em>despair</em>, with all its implied hopelessness and impotence, seems more accurate. When I’m depressed, happiness is inconceivable.</p><p>I even struggle to remember positive events accurately—every happy memory feels fake or tainted.</p><p>Most recently, I experienced a train of thought along these lines:</p><blockquote><p>When was the last time I was <em>truly</em> happy? It must have been years ago. Maybe in college…but no, I was depressed then too. Every supposedly happy time I can recall, I was on drugs. I was probably happy as a child. I guess I’ve never really been happy in my adult life.</p></blockquote><p>Literally an hour before, I’d been laughing with my girlfriend and our puppy in a local park. Somehow, the depressive mind recasts positive memories in a negative light. It infects everything it touches.</p><p>Worse is the inability to conceive of any future happiness. The conviction that <em>things will always be this way</em> compounds my present-moment sadness, enlarges it to an infinite magnitude. I’m crushed under the weight of all that future suffering, and its apparent inevitability.</p><p>It’s easy to see how suicide starts to feel like a good option. Death is the only escape<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-anchor-2" target="_self">2</a>.</p><p>I’m lucky that I’ve always been able to convince my rational mind that the sense of permanence is false, even if I can’t fully internalize that belief. I wouldn’t say it gives me <em>hope</em> exactly, but it keeps me grounded enough to stay safe.</p><h1 id="aberrant-beliefs">Aberrant Beliefs</h1><p>I’ve always been skeptical of neurochemical explanations for depression, and was happy to see a recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01661-0">large meta-analysis</a> provide evidence against that narrative.</p><p>The root cause of my depressive episodes is a single aberrant belief: the belief that I am somehow <em>doomed</em>, cursed, damned, fated to be miserable. It’s this belief that turns mere sadness into an all-consuming depression.</p><p>This belief has flapped on and off throughout my life. At best, it manifests as a sense that I’m broken as a person, categorically different from the happy people around me. At worst, it takes on cosmic proportions, centered around an obsessive fixation on Christian hell. The latter usually comes about if I also believe I <em>deserve</em> to suffer—say, because I’ve done something selfish or hurt someone I care about.</p><p>Worse, the belief that I’m intrinsically sad is extremely sticky. It creates its own evidence: believing it makes me unhappy, which further convinces me that unhappiness is my fate. The longer this vicious feedback loop continues, the stronger it gets.</p><h1 id="anhedonia">Anhedonia</h1><p>True to what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding">predictive coding</a> would tell us, this belief colors the world around me. I expect the world to be ugly, and that makes me more attuned to ugliness.</p><p>Everything starts to look like dog shit.</p><p>You’d think distraction would be a simple way to at least alleviate the symptoms of depression. Just lose yourself in something you love—even a guilty pleasure—and you can get some relief for an hour or two.</p><p>Sometimes this works, but often it doesn’t. My favorite shows, music, video games, food, etc. all feel pointless and bland. Depression literally changes your perception, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23751244/">decreasing visual contrast</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1963351/">impairing auditory processing</a>.</p><p>Most recently, while struggling to fend off despair, I decided to have a drink. That’s something depressed people do to cope, right? I got through about half a craft beer—one I typically love—and poured the rest down the sink.</p><p>When I’m depressed, all the easiest paths to enjoyment are closed off. This only reinforces the sense of <em>no escape</em>.</p><h1 id="perverse-incentives">Perverse Incentives</h1><p>The fact that minor vices lose their appeal during depression might be a feature rather than a bug. Drinking and media-binging are likely to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871617304362">deepen</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10802-020-00715-7">depression</a> long-term, even if they sometimes provide temporary relief.</p><p>What’s truly perplexing is the inability to engage in <em>healthy</em> behaviors.</p><p>The best way for me to escape a depressive spiral is to engage in wholesome, productive activities. Walking outside; exercising; cooking; spending time with people I love; all these chip away at the underlying cause of depression. They remind me that I’m capable of self-generating happiness.</p><p>Problem is, all these things seem awful in the moment. The <em>last</em> thing I want to do is be around people. And I have no energy to get off the couch, let alone work out.</p><p>This is easily the strangest feature of depression. It’s like if dehydration made water taste awful, or if hunger made you vomit.</p><p>Conversely, I crave activities that will reinforce my depression. I want to sit on the couch and ruminate on all the things that are wrong in my life. I want to poke the sadness with my tongue like a canker sore, tasting it over and over again, reminding myself it’s there.</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdba1fbd-2cc6-444f-851e-f7419bb1f434_64x64.png" target="_blank"><div class="image2-inset"><source type="image/webp"><img alt="" class="sizing-normal" height="64" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdba1fbd-2cc6-444f-851e-f7419bb1f434_64x64.png" width="64"><div></div></div></a></figure></div><div><hr></div><p>The one exception here is meditation. It’s the only healthy activity I can easily slip into, probably because it requires no energy, and I can start off by ruminating.</p><p>That said, I wouldn’t recommend beginning a meditation practice while in the throes of a depressive episode. I fell into depression when first learning to meditate, and it probably exacerbated the issue. I would sit there for literally an hour or two, silently obsessing over all the things that were wrong with me.</p><p>But now that I’ve trained my mind a bit, it’s a tremendous refuge.</p><p>For minutes at a time, I can sit in a mindstate where any sense of past and future evaporates. And as a result, any sense of permanence, of being <em>stuck</em>, disappears as well. The depression reverts to mere sadness, and even that usually dissipates into a comfortable equanimity.</p><p>To be clear, meditation is a potent salve, not a cure. When I stand up and come back to the world, the depression is still there waiting for me. I usually have more strength to shoulder it, and it feels a little lighter. But it’s still there.</p><p>The only cure is to flip that aberrant belief back off—to convince myself, at a deep, instinctual level, that I will feel happy again in the future. And more importantly, that I <em>deserve</em> happiness.</p><p>If I ever find a way to do that reliably, I’ll report back.</p><p class="button-wrapper"><a class="button primary" href="https://superbowl.substack.com/subscribe"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p><em>If you or someone you know is struggling with depression or suicidal thoughts, help is available, and <strong>it does get better</strong>.
